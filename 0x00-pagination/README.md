Pagination
Most endpoints that returns a list of entities will need to have some sort of pagination.

Without pagination, a simple search could return millions or even billions of hits causing extraneous network traffic.

Paging requires an implied ordering. By default this may be the itemâ€™s unique identifier, but can be other ordered fields such as a created date.

Offset Pagination
This is the simplest form of paging. Limit/Offset became popular with apps using SQL databases which already have LIMIT and OFFSET as part of the SQL SELECT Syntax. Very little business logic is required to implement Limit/Offset paging.

Limit/Offset Paging would look like GET /items?limit=20&offset=100. This query would return the 20 rows starting with the 100th row.
